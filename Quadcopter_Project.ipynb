    "I've tried the DDPG algorithm. First, I've tried to run the implementation of DDPG proposed by the project's guide. I played with different hyperparameters, but wasn't able to get it working. Later I found [this article](http://pemami4911.github.io/blog/2016/08/21/ddpg-rl.html) decribing the DDPG algorithm. I've tried the accompanying [code](https://github.com/pemami4911/deep-rl/tree/master/ddpg) implementation of the algorithm on the OpenAI's Pendulum-v0 task. The algorithm achieved an acceptable performance in less than a hundred episodes. The original code was implemented using the tflearn framework. I've refactored it and made it Tensorflow only. Initially I tried to rewrite it on Keras, but turned out the Keras' backend implementation isn't flexible enough for this algorithm, that's why I switched to TF-only implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've kept the original values of hyperparameters proposed by the article's source code:\n",
    "* gamma: 0.99\n",
    "* minibatch size: 64\n",
    "* tau: 0.001\n",
    "* actor learning rate: 0.0001\n",
    "* critic learning rate: 0.001\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm implements actor and critic using separate neural networks. The actor's network has the following structure:\n",
    "* fully-connected layer with 128 outputs and ReLU activation. Takes the environment state vector as an input.\n",
    "* batch normalization layer\n",
    "* fully-connected layer with 128 outputs and ReLU activation\n",
    "* batch normalization layer\n",
    "* fully-connected layer with number of outputs equal to the size of the environment action vector and tanh activation\n",
    "* linear transformation layer that maps tanh to the actual range of action values\n",
    "\n",
    "The critic's network has two input layers. Each of the input layers followed by a separate sets of layers. First set of layers:\n",
    "* fully-connected layer with 128 outputs and ReLU activation. Takes the environment state vector as an input.\n",
    "* batch normalization layer\n",
    "* fully-connected layer with 128 outputs and linear activation\n",
    "* batch normalization layer\n",
    "The second set of layers:\n",
    "* fully-connected layer with 128 outputs and linear activation. Takes the agent's action vector as an input\n",
    "* batch normalization layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs of these two sets of layers then combined using the sum operator followed by the ReLU activation function and a fully-connected layer with linear activation and a single output, representing the value of an action taken by the agent."

    "- Was it an easy task to learn or hard?\n",
    "- Was there a gradual learning curve, or an aha moment?\n",
    "- How good was the final performance of the agent? (e.g. mean rewards over the last 10 episodes)\n",

    "It took several thousands episodes to learn an acceptable behavior. Compared to the pendulum task, where agent learnd behavior in less then a hundred episodes, this task can be considered as hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the average reward, I'd say that the learning curve is gradual. We can see spikes of the average reward, corresponding to temporary unlearning. Those spikes could be resulted by the lag between the actor's and the critic's learning processes or by the noise applied to the actions generated by the actor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best average reward achieved by the agent is around -1, which correspondes to the value of 0.02 per step of the RMS error of the combined position and orientation of the quadcopter."

    "**Question 4**: Briefly summarize your experience working on this project. You can use the following prompts for ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What was the hardest part of the project? (e.g. getting started, plotting, specifying the task, etc.)\n",
    "- Did you find anything interesting in how the quadcopter or your agent behaved?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "\n",
    "I think, the hardest part of the project for me was the initial implementation of the algorithm. Gladly, I've found some implementation on Internet, that I could use as a reference point. I used the OpenAI's pendulum task for testing. That helps to keep the functionality while doing refactoring. Refactoring itself helped me to get a good understanding of the algorithm's implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used to print out the position and the orientation of the quadcopter after each step of the training. During the early episodes of training, the quadcopter tended always to fall down, then there were several episodes, where the quadcopter always flyed up high, then several episodes, where it flied to the side. Looks like that's how the agent learns the Q-function.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've started with the pendulum task. Then tried the hovering task with two steps episodes. After that continued with 10 steps episodes. And finally used 1 seconds episodes (50 steps). Gradual increasing of complexity helped me to understand the relation between complexity and convergance. The longer tasks or more complex tasks converge slower. I guess, that the longer and more complex tasks require the hierarchical approach for better convergance.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think, that the performance of the agent can be improved by using the [Hierarchical Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00948) algorithm."
